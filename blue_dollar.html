Many goods and services are cheap in Argentina relative to the United States
 given the official currency rate. They are about twice as chep given the 
 unoffical one. The argentinve peso undergoes so much inflation on a 
 regular bassis that many nationals prefer more stable currency, such
  as the U.S. Dollar. This value is appreciated by Western Union, 
  purveyors of crypto currency, and entreponeurs on la calle Florida.
   If this conversion is a bit confusing, you are not alone. Before 
   arriving, I had heard that The blue rate was about double the official 
   one, and that you could get it at Western Union or Calle Florida. 
   Exchanging money on the street seems a bit dangerous, but it goes 
   on in broad daylight in obvious view of authorities. I wouldn’t 
   worry at all about getting the money exchanged safely (but do your 
   research on the blue dollar rate before making the exchange), 
   and be careful not that not to flaunt the cash in return to 
   boisterously. Keep in mind that a rate of 300 to one ends up
    giving the trader a sizeable wad of cash. The next option is 
    Western Union. This sounds like a sure thing, but there is a litttle 
    confusion and doubt about the process. First, by wiring money from a
     US bank accound, credit, or debit card, you will be able to pick up 
     the blue dollar exchange rate from a Western Union location. They 
     generally charge a fee, though sometimes a google search can yield 
     promo codes to forgo that. That’s the part that confused me at the 
     beginning, now for the doubt. Be prepared for a long line when 
     arriving, and there is always a chance they will not have enough 
     money for your transaction. Another note, so far both my transactions
      have raised red flags at WU fraud alert. I just had to call them and
       verify a few things for the transfer to go through. The third way 
       is one I haven’t tried just yet, but may be the best one. Using a 
       crypto trading app like Binance, you can move dollars to crypto, 
       and then withdraw that at blue dollar to peso rate. There is no 
       transaction feee like Western Union has, and you can withdraw 
       from one of the many ubiquitous pagofacil facilites (which also 
       offer longer hours than WU)
